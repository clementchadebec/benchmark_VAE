**********************************
Welcome to pythae's documentation!
**********************************

This library aims at gathering some of the common (Variational) Autoencoders implementations so that
we can conduct benchmark analysis and reproducible research!

**News** ðŸ“¢

As of v0.1.0, `Pythae` now supports distributed training using PyTorch's `DDP <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/ddp.html>`_). You can now train your favorite VAE faster and on larger datasets, still with a few lines of code.
See :ref:`Distributed Training`.
